Here are a few examples taken from MyHDL documentation. You can try them too by installing python (if not already done) and MyHDL. 

To install python, run : 

	  sudo apt-get install python
	  sudo apt-get install python3

To install MyHDL, run :

Clone the repo. Then, you can try the examples by running
